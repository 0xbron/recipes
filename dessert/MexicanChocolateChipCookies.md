#Mexican Chocolate-Chip Cookies

##Ingredients
2 cups all-purpose flour
½ tablespoon kosher salt
¼ teaspoon baking powder
1½ sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature
1¼ cups light brown sugar
1 egg
¾ cup semisweet chocolate, chopped
¾ cup Mexican chocolate, chopped

##Directions
Preheat the oven to 350°. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, salt and baking powder. Set aside. In a standing mixer, mix the butter and sugar together until well incorporated. Add the egg and mix until incorporated, scraping down the mixture from the sides of the bowl.

Add the flour mixture and blend until a dough forms. Gently mix in the semisweet and Mexican chocolates.

Using an ice cream scoop, form 1½-tablespoon-size balls of dough and place them on a sheet pan; leave about 1 inch between cookies. Place the pan in the oven and bake until browned on the edges and set in the center, about 10 to 12 minutes. Remove the cookies from the oven. After 5 minutes, transfer the cookies to a cooling rack. Repeat with the remaining dough until all the cookies are made. Serve warm or at room temperature.
