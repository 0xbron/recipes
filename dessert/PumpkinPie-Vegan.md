#Vegan Pumpkin Pie

The two ways to make this pie:

1) Pure Pumpkin Pie
2) Pumpkin Cheesecake Pie

##Ingredients
###Pure Pumpkin Pie
8 ounces tofu cream cheese
30 ounces (about 3 3/4 cups) canned Pumpkin Pie Mix (or sub ingredients shown above)
1 1/4 cups soaked raw cashews (soaked overnight in salted water)
3 Tbsp lemon or orange juice (optional - adds a slight zippy undertone)
2 tsp cinnamon (optional)

2 graham cracker pie crusts (or your own recipe)
handful of cashews for garnish

###Pumpkin Cheesecake Pie

16 ounces tofu cream cheese
1 can - 15 ounces canned Pumpkin Pie Mix (or sub ingredients)
1 3/4 cups soaked raw cashews (soaked overnight in salted water)
3 Tbsp lemon juice
2 tsp cinnamon (optional)

2 graham cracker pie crusts (or your own recipe)
handful of cashews for garnish

##Directions
Soak your raw cashews in salted water overnight or at least 6 hours. They should break apart easily and be tender to bite when properly soaked.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Drain your nuts and set aside. Also set aside about 15-20 cashews or garnish. Gather all ingredients and set aside as well.

In a food processor, add the cream cheese, pumpkin pie mix (or substitute ingredients), cashews and lemon juice.

Blend on high until a creamy mixture is reached. Pulse in additional cinnamon (other spices may be added as well).

Pour your puree into your two pie crusts. 

Swirl and smooth top with fork. Dot on cashews around the edge and center as you'd like.

Bake at 375 for 30 minutes. Cool. Place in fridge to firm before serving.
