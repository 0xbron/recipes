# Pomegranate Spiced Poached Pears

## Ingredients
* 2 firm pears, Anjou or Bosc, peeled, halved, cored
* 2 cups pomegranate juice
* 2 cups apple cider
* One 3" cinnamon stick
* peel from one clementine
* 2 whole cloves
* 2 star anise
* 3 black cardamon pods
* One 1" piece fresh ginger, peeled, cut into thin slivers
* Orange Cashew Cream for serving, if desired

## Directions
Place pomegranate juice, apple cider, cinnamon stick, clementine peel, cloves, star anise, cardamon pods and ginger in rice cooker. Place pear halves in poaching liquid.

Close rice cooker and cook on "white rice" setting for 50 minutes, or until tender (a toothpick should go through easily).

Open cover and turn pears over. Let sit for 1 hour. Turn pears over again and let sit for another hour. You can also refrigerate these overnight for a more intense flavor and color.

Serve with Orange Cashew Cream.
