# Steph’s Jamaican Squash Soup

When peeling the brittle skin of raw kabocha, do so carefully, using a very sharp knife or cleaver, and peel away from you.

When selecting your scotch bonnet or habanero, make sure it’s fresh and that the skin and stem are not weak in any way. Stir the soup carefully once the chili has been added, so that it doesn’t burst in the soup.

Makes 6 servings

## Ingredients
* 1 tbs vegetable oil
* 2 leeks, cleaned well, trimmed and chopped
* 2 large carrots, peeled, trimmed and chopped
* 2 ribs of celery, trimmed and chopped
* 1L (4 c) vegetable stock
* 1 kabocha squash, peeled, seeds removed, cut into large pieces
* 1 butternut squash, peeled, seeds removed, cut into 1-inch pieces
* 2 sweet potatoes, peeled, cut into 1-inch pieces
* 7 whole sprigs thyme, tied with kitchen twine
* 1 fresh scotch bonnet pepper (or a habanero pepper)
* 1 1/2 cups frozen corn
* 1 tsp Kosher salt
* 1/2 tsp ground black pepper

## Directions
Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the leeks, carrots and celery and saute for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the broth and 2 cups of water to the pot. Add the kabocha, bring to a boil, covered, and then lower heat to a simmer. Simmer for 15  minutes, covered. Add the butternut squash, sweet potatoes, thyme, scotch bonnet pepper, 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper. Stir, cover and simmer for 1/2 hour, stirring occasionally. Add corn, 1/2 tsp salt, stir and cook uncovered for 10 minutes. The soup will become thicker the more you stir and the more the kabocha breaks down. You can thin out the soup (both now and when reheating) with some water if desired. Serve with a cut scotch bonnet pepper for dipping–if you dare!
