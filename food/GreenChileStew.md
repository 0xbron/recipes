#Katy's Green Chile Stew

My green chile stew recipe is below.

A few notes: I just use veggie crumbles or soyrizo for the ground beef and a few cans of diced green chile if I can't find it frozen (the flavor isn't as strong and I usually end up using way more than 8oz but it works). Not sure if you guys have Albertsons up in the bay but I believe Bueno distributes their frozen chile through them. I also usually add more potatoes and a can of black beans or baked beans if I can't find ranch style... I think the baked beans are basically sweeter than ranch style? I also only kind of use the measurements as a general guide, tbh.

Hope you like it!

##Ingredients
1 8oz package of frozen Bueno
1 8oz jar of Pace regular picante, at least medium heat (not thick & chunky)
1 15oz can black label ranch style beans
1 lb lean ground beef (or small chunks of stew meat)
1 large onion
3 to 4 potatoes, cubed Â¾"
4 to 6 beef bouillon cubes (optional)

##Directions
Brown meat in a large pot with the onion, add salt and pepper to taste.

When cooked, add frozen green chile, Pace, and beans. Then add potatoes and enough water to sufficiently cover all ingredients. (Optional, add the bouillon here.)

Cook slowly until the potatoes are soft. (Or cook 4-5 hours in a Crockpot on low.)
