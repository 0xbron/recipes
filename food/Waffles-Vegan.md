#Vegan Waffles

##Ingredients
12 ounces silken tofu (2 cups crumbled)
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup melted and cooled coconut oil, plus more for the waffle iron
Juice of 1/2 lemon (about 1 1/2 tablespoons)
1 cup flour
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

##Directions
Preheat your waffle iron. In a blender or food processor, puree the tofu, water and lemon juice. Slowly drizzle in the coconut oil with the blender/food processor running.

In a mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.

Add the tofu mixture to the flour mixture, stirring just until all the flour is moistened. Lumps are okay.

Brush the waffle iron with a little more melted coconut oil (or spray it with pan spray). Cook the batter in the waffle iron: fill it about 2/3 full, and cook until the steam significantly slows or subsides and the waffle is golden and crispy.

You can hold cooked waffles on a rack in a 200Â° F oven until you've used up all the batter (try not to stack them), then serve warm with fruit and whipped cream, or maple syrup (or all three). Leftovers are excellent when toasted.
