# One Pan Pasta

## Ingredients
* 12 ounces linguine
* 12 ounces cherry or grape tomatoes, halved or quartered if large
* 1 onion, thinly sliced (about 2 cups)
* 4 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced
* 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
* 2 sprigs basil, plus torn leaves for garnish
* 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving
* Coarse salt & freshly ground black pepper
* 4 1/2 cups water
* Freshly grated Parmesan cheese

## Directions
Combine pasta, tomatoes, onion, garlic, red-pepper flakes, basil, oil, 2 teaspoons salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and water in a large straight-sided skillet (the linguine should lay flat).

Bring to a boil over high heat. Boil mixture, stirring and turning pasta frequently with tongs or a fork, until pasta is al dente and water has nearly evaporated, about 9 minutes.

Season to taste with salt and pepper, divide among 4 bowls, and garnish with basil. Serve with olive oil and Parmesan.
