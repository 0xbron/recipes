# Zucchini, Onion, and Chard Soup

## Ingredients
* 2 medium/small red onions
* 6 medium/small zucchini
* 1 bunch of swiss chard (I used red)
* olive oil
* garlic (fresh, jarred, or powdered works... I used garlic salt since I
was out of fresh garlic)
* salt and pepper
* red chili flakes or cayenne pepper (something to give it zip)

## Directions
Chop onion and zucchini into small/medium chunks. Sautee in olive oil
and garlic (salt/pepper optional at this point - you can add it later)
till slightly cooked. Zucchini should still be firm, but onions will
likely be a little softer.

Drop cooked zucchini/onions into blender and add warm water as
necessary to puree and so you're happy with the consistency (i.e., not
too thick and not too watery). Pour blended zucchini/onions/water into
the soup pot and turn on to medium to heat up (you'll want to turn it
down once it has heated up to just keep it hot, but not boil).

Chop swiss chard stalk and leaves into bite size chunks (discard maybe
the bottom 2 inches of the stalk). Sautee in olive oil, garlic, red
pepper flakes/cayenne pepper (and salt as needed) until tender/wilted.
(Leaves should be similar to cooked spinach.) Stir swiss chard into
the soup pot mix and season with additional garlic, red pepper, and
salt to taste.
