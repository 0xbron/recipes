# Russian Vegetable Pie

## Ingredients
* 1/2 head of cabbage
* 1 medium onion
* Tarragon to taste
* 1 package of cream cheese
* 3 sticks Butter
* 2 Cups of white mushrooms (or wild)
* 6 eggs
* 3 cups flour
* Ice water

## Directions
Preheat oven to 425

Pie crust:

Mix 1 1/2 cups of flower with 1 stick of butter, either grate butter or cube into small bits. Make sure butter is cold & straight from the fridge. Pinch the bits of butter into the flour until there are no butter chunks and the mixture is flakey in texture.
Then add a tablespoon at a time of ice water and mix thoroughly. Roll flat once mixed OR you can use milk instead of water and knead flat (works great if you don't have a rolling pin!).

Repeat pie crust recipe for a pie top.

Once your crust is done refrigerate it in the pie pan.

Boil the 6 eggs at 10 minutes in a teaspoon of baking soda (helps the shell peel easily).

Chop the 1/2 head of cabbage and medium onion into 1/2 inch thick strips, toss with generous amounts of tarragon and salt. I recommend priming the pan with olive oil. Cover while sauteing. The cabbage and onion should only be slightly softened not squishy.

Saut√© the sliced mushrooms in butter, taking care to make sure each one is browned on both sides.

Return to your crust and cut strips of cream cheese to lay in the bottom of the pie, work the cream cheese down with a spatula until it's an even layer on the bottom of the pie pan.

Peel your cooled boiled eggs and slice width wise, I recommend into thirds.

Place eggs on top of the cream cheese layer.

Add the cabbage and onion mixture on top of your egg layer, then top with a layer of sauted mushrooms, top with pie crust, cut slits for the pie to steam.

Optionally you can beat an egg and brush the egg over the top to golden brown the top (I recommend it, it makes a difference!).

Put the pie in the oven for 45 mins - 1hr 30 mins until crust is done.

Salt and pepper to taste and enjoy.
