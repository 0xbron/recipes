#Artichokes

Serves 2-4

###Spring- Peak Artichoke Season

I remember my first artichoke as a kid. A neighbor brought this strange vegetable over, ready to eat. She taught us how to snap off a leaf and pull the inside of the leaf across your teeth to scrap off the meaty part. With an earthy, nutty flavor, I’ve been a fan ever since.

While artichokes are available almost year round, spring is their peak season. I like to boil or steam them and serve with a quick mayonnaise-based lemon garlic dipping sauce.

###How to Buy Artichokes
Fresh artichokes should be compact, plump and feel heavy for their size. If the artichoke squeaks when squeezed, it’s fresh. The leaves should be green and tightly closed. If the leaves (called bracts) are brown and splitting, the artichoke is most likely past its prime.

The exception to this is winter harvest artichokes. They may have light brown scaling on the leaves due to frostbite. Although not as pretty, they still taste good.

###Boil, Steam, Grill
After boiling or steaming, pluck the hot artichokes out of the pan with tongs, drain, and place on a platter for serving. For extra flavor and presentation, try finishing them on the grill.

Split the artichokes in half from top to bottom, remove the fuzzy choke, brush with a little olive oil and place on the grill for a few minutes until a lightly charred. Grilling gives them a lightly smokey flavor.

After grilling, cut the artichoke halves in two for easier to eat quarters size pieces. Have an empty bowl handy to toss discarded leaves into.

A versatile vegetable, artichokes can be served as an appetizer, snack, salad, or as part of a main course. Pack them up for a picnic or tailgate. Use them for lunch and stuff with chicken, crab or tuna salad. Recipes abound for ways to use the green globes, so enjoy them while they are at peak season and throughout the year.

##Ingredients
2 large fresh artichokes
1 large lemon, cut in quarters
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 dried bay leaf
6 black peppercorns
Sprinkle of kosher salt
2 fresh thyme sprigs
2-3 fresh whole garlic cloves, peeled and smashed

##Directions
###Prepare artichoke for cooking

To prepare whole artichokes, cut the top one third off with a serrated knife. The teeth of a serrated knife make it easier to cut through the tough exterior. Discard the trimmings.

Trim the bottom stem flush with the base. Next, trim off the prickly point of each leaf with a pair of kitchen scissors. Rub a cut lemon over the artichoke to prevent it from turning brown.

###How to cook an artichoke

In a deep pan wide enough to hold artichokes, place trimmed artichokes stem side up in the bottom of the pan (or place on a steamer rack). Fill pan with a few inches of cold water. Squeeze lemon juice over the artichokes and put rinds in the pan. Drizzle in olive oil, sprinkle with kosher salt, add bay leaf, black peppercorns, thyme sprigs and garlic.

Cover the pot with a tight fitting lid and bring to a boil. When steam starts coming out of the pan, turn the heat down to low and cook artichokes until you can pierce the center of the stem with a paring knife. The timing will depend on the size of the artichokes. For big ones test at 20-25 minutes and continue if needed for a few minutes. Another way to tell when an artichoke is ready is to pull off and outer leaf. It should come off easily.

Remove the artichokes from the pan and drain on a towel. At this point, you can arrange the artichokes on a platter and serve them hot, at room temperature or chilled.

To finish by grilling, split the artichokes in half from top to bottom, remove the fuzzy choke, brush with a little olive oil and place on the grill for a few minutes until a little charred. This enhances the earthy, nutty flavor and makes for a great presentation.
