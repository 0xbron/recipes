# Pesto Spaghetti Squash

## Ingredients
* 2 (2 1/2–-3-pound) spaghetti squash (see note)

For the chickpeas

* 2 (14.5-ounce) cans chickpeas, rinsed and drained
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 tablespoon chili powder
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
* 1–2 teaspoons Sriracha (optional)

For the pesto

* 1 cup kale, packed
* 1 cup fresh basil, packed
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/4 cup walnuts or pine nuts
* 1/4 cup olive oil
* 1/2 teaspoon sea salt

## Directions
Preheat oven to 400°F.

Pierce the spaghetti squash several times with a fork. Place on a baking sheet, and bake for 75–90 minutes, until tender.

Cut open, and let cool on baking sheet. Scoop out seeds, and run a fork through each half to create noodles.

Meanwhile, prepare the chickpeas. In a large bowl, combine all ingredients until chickpeas are well-coated.

Spread on a baking sheet, and bake for 20–25 mins (in the 400°F oven), or until chickpeas are browned and crispy.

While the squash and chickpeas are baking, prepare the pesto. Combine all pesto ingredients with 1/4 cup water in a blender or food processor. Thin out with additional water if necessary.

Fill each spaghetti squash with a quarter of the pesto and chickpeas.

Serve warm.
