#Lemony Risotto with Shrimp

##Ingredients
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
5 teaspoons butter, divided
1 cup finely chopped onion
1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest
1 cup arborio rice
1/4 cup white wine
3 cups chicken broth
12 medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 cup blanched corn kernels (fresh or thawed frozen)
3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese
Ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon fine chopped parsley, fresh
4 lemon wedges
1 tablespoon freshly grated parmesan cheese
Salt to taste

##Directions
Set the rice cooker for the Quick Cook or Regular cycle. When the bottom of the bowl gets hot, add oil and 1 tbsp (15 mL) butter and let butter melt. Sauté onion for about 3 minutes or until softened and translucent. Stir in lemon zest.

Stir in rice until completely coated. Sauté for about 4 minutes or until mostly translucent and only a dot of white remains. Stir in wine and cook for 3 to 4 minutes or until evaporated. Stir in broth. Close the lid and reset for the Porridge or Regular cycle. Set a timer for 20 minutes. Stir two or three times while the risotto is cooking.

When the timer sounds, fold in shrimp, corn and lemon juice. Set the timer for 5 minutes.

When the timer sounds, check to make sure risotto is al dente and shrimp are pink and opaque. If necessary, continue cooking, checking for doneness every 5 minutes. Fold in the remaining butter. Fold in Parmesan. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve immediately, garnished with parsley and lemon wedges. Serve additional Parmesan on the side.

Variation
Substitute 1 cup (250 mL) chopped grilled chicken for the shrimp, adding it with the Parmesan.

Tips
To blanch fresh corn kernels, bring a small saucepan of water to a boil over high heat. Add corn and boil for 1 to 2 minutes or until tender-crisp. Using a slotted spoon, transfer corn to a bowl of ice water and let cool completely. Drain.

Try using Meyer lemons for the juice and zest.
