#Vegan Coconut Chana Saag

Spinach is often used in saag, but I prefer the sturdiness of chard, cabbage or spring greens. If you'd like to use spinach, add a few extra cups, as it will break down more than its less delicate cousins.

I love the mix of plump chickpeas and cooked-down greens swimming in sultry spices. The versions I've tried have typically been made with a tomato base, but I've seen it made with cream as well. I decided to pair the two to make a rich, coconut-creamy tomato concoction that hits all the right notes. I love the hint of mystery that anise seeds bring to Indian-inspired food. Serve over basmati rice, and don't be ashamed to pick up a jar of mango chutney as well.

Serves 6

##Ingredients
2 tbsp refined coconut oil
1 medium yellow onion, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 tbsp minced fresh ginger
2 tbsp mild curry powder
1 tsp salt
Several pinches freshly ground black pepper
½ tsp anise seeds (or crushed fennel seeds)
¼ tsp garam masala
½ tsp ground cumin
¼ tsp cayenne (or more or less, depending on how spicy you like it)
1 (680g) tin whole tomatoes
2 (425g) tins chickpeas, rinsed and drained (3 cups)
225g kale, chopped
1 (396g) tin regular or lite coconut milk
2 tbsp fresh lime juice

##Directions
Preheat a large saucepan over a medium heat and add the coconut oil. Saute the onion in the oil for 5-7 minutes, until lightly browned.

Add the garlic and ginger and saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the curry powder, salt, pepper, anise seeds, garam masala, cumin and cayenne, and toss to coat the onions, letting the spices toast for a minute or so.

Add the tomato juice from the tin, scraping the bottom of the pan to deglaze. Simply hold the tomatoes and let the juice strain through your fingers. Now add the tomatoes from the tin, squishing them with your fingers as you put them in the pot, to mash them up. Add the chickpeas and mix well.

Cover the pan and bring the heat up a bit. Let it simmer for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the kale and stir until wilted, then let it simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes more to cook it down even further.

Add the coconut milk and heat through. Add the lime juice, then taste for seasoning. It tastes best if you let it sit for 10 minutes or so, but if you can't wait, then just dig in. Serve over basmati rice with a little mango chutney and coriander on top.
