#Cinnamon Whiskey/Bourbon

##Ingredients
1-2 dried red chile pepper
5-6 sticks of cinnamon
simple syrup
whiskey or bourbon of choice

##Directions
Put cinnamon sticks in a large mason jar. Add approximately 1-1.5" of simple syrup. Pour in whiskey or bourbon, leaving approximately 1" at the top of the mason jar. Screw on lid and gently shake to stir.

Gently shake 1-2 times a day, letting the cinnamon infuse for approximately 5 days. Test to see if more simple syrup is needed.

After 5 days, add the dried chile. Gently shake 1-2 times per day, testing the flavor after 2 days. Continue infusing cinnamon and chile until desired flavor is achieved.

Remove cinnamon sticks, chile, and strain if needed to remove chile seeds. Enjoy!
