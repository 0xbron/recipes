# Rice Cooker Frittata With Summer Vegetables

## Common Allergens
* dairy
* eggs

## Ingredients
The vegetables:
* 1 whole garlic clove, peeled
* 1 small red or yellow pepper, cut into small dice
* 1 small potato, peeled and finely julienned
* 1 small zucchini, sliced into thin rounds
* salt and pepper
* 1 Tbs. olive oil

The egg mixture:
* 6 large eggs
* 2 Tbs. grated cheese of any kind (optional)
* salt and pepper
* 1 Tbs. olive oil

Equipment needed:
* Rice cooker
* Frying pan
* Burner or stove (see Notes for what to do if you don’t have a burner or stove)
* chopsticks or fork to mix the eggs
* spatula or chopsticks to stir the vegetables around

## Directions
Heat up the frying pan with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Add the garlic clove, and let the oil heat up until the garlic is lightly brown. Discard the garlic clove.

Add the vegetables. The key with the vegetables is to cut them up as small and thinly is you can, so that they cook fast. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.

Put 1 tablespoon of olive oil in the rice cooker bowl. Spread it around the bottom and about 2 inches /5 cm up the sides, using a paper towel. Add the eggs, grated cheese, salt and pepper, and beat the eggs in the bowl (take care not to scratch the surface if you’re using a metal fork for this). Add the vegetables and distribute them evenly in the egg mixture.

Put the bowl in the rice cooker and switch on, using the regular rice setting. When the cooking cycle finishes, the frittata is done!
