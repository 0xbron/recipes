# Quick Winter Squash Soup with Spicy Toasted Pumpkin Seeds

Using frozen winter squash purée makes putting together this soup extremely speedy; then just let it simmer while the turkey roasts. The lime juice may seem like an unusual Thanksgiving ingredient, but its tart flavor gives a lift to the sweetness of the squash and tempers the spicy toasted pumpkin seeds. The seeds themselves are addictive, so if you think you might want to have extra around for noshing, consider doubling that recipe. They will keep for at least a week or two in an airtight container—if they last that long!

Makes 4 servings

## Common Allergens
* dairy

## Ingredients
* 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
* 3 shallots, finely chopped
* 2 (12-ounce) packages frozen winter squash purée, thawed
* 3 cups vegetable stock

For pumpkin seeds:
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 3/4 cup raw green (hulled) pumpkin seeds
* 3/4 teaspoon ground cumin
* Pinch of cayenne pepper

To finish:
* 1 teaspoon finely grated fresh lime zest
* 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice

## Directions
Make soup:

In large saucepan over moderately high heat, melt butter. Add shallots and sauté until translucent, about 3 minutes. Stir in squash and stock and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until soup thickens, about 30 minutes.

While soup simmers, make pumpkin seeds:

In small skillet over moderately high heat, heat oil. Add pumpkin seeds and cook, stirring constantly, until seeds begin to pop, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in cumin and cayenne pepper and continue to cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Transfer to bowl and season with generous pinch of kosher or coarse sea salt.

Finish and serve:

When soup has thickened, remove from heat and stir in lime zest and juice. Season with kosher or fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Ladle into bowls, garnish with pumpkin seeds, and serve.
