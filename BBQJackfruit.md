# BBQ Jackfruit

## Common Allergens
* wheat gluten
* added sugar

## Ingredients
* 3-20 oz. cans jackfruit in water or brine
* 1 tsp. olive oil
* 1/2 onion, chopped
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 tsp. sugar
* 1 tsp. brown sugar
* 1 tsp. ground cumin
* 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper
* 1 tsp. chili powder
* 1 tsp. paprika
* 1 1/2 tsp. liquid smoke
* 1 cup vegetable broth
* 1/2 cup vegan BBQ sauce (your favorite store bought or homemade kind)
* Buns for pulled pork sandwiches or corn tortillas for gluten-free pulled jackfruit tacos

## Directions
Preheat the over to 400 degrees.

Drain and rinse the jackfruit, remove the core and cut each piece in half. As you do this, remove the seeds.

Saute the onion in olive oil over medium heat for about 7 minutes or until translucent, then add the garlic and saute a minute or so longer.

Add the jackfruit, sugar, spices, and liquid smoke. Stir until the jackfruit is evenly covered.

Add the vegetable broth, cover, and simmer for 10-15 minutes until all liquid is absorbed.

Use a spatula to mash and divide the jackfruit until it looks similar in appearance to pulled pork.

Spread the jackfruit out on a baking sheet and cook for 20 minutes.

Remove from oven and cover with bbq sauce.

Return the jackfruit to the oven and cook for another 10-15 minutes or until the jackfruit is lightly browned.
