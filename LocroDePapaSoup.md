Add the potatoes to the pot and mix until they are coated with the refrito. Continue cooking for about 5 minutes, stirring a every couple of minutes.

Add the water and bring to boil, cook until the potatoes are very tender. Use a potato masher to mash the potatoes in the pot, donâ€™t mash all of them, the consistency of the soup should be creamy with small tender chunks of potatoes.

Turn the heat down to low, stir in the milk and let cook for about 5 more minutes. You can add more milk if the soup is too thick.

Add salt to taste

Add the grated cheese and cilantro, mix well, and remove from the heat.

Serve warm with the avocados, scallions, queso or feta cheese and aji hot sauce.
