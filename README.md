# Recipes I Dig
Collection of recipes I've fallen in love with over the years.

All recipes are vegetarian or vegan.

## Common Allergens
The following information is called out in each recipe:

* dairy
* eggs
* nuts
* wheat gluten
* added sugar

In many cases, allergen-free ingredients can be substituted (such as butter vs vegan butter, wheat flour vs. gluten free flour, etc.).
